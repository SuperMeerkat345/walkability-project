UPDATED PROMPTS FOR 5 LEVELS:

prompts = [
    "No visible sidewalks, paths, or pedestrian infrastructure. No safe crossing points or pedestrian-friendly zones. Unsafe or obstructed pathways (e.g., heavy traffic, no buffer from cars). Wide roads with fast-moving traffic, making pedestrians feel exposed. Unpleasant, unattractive environment (e.g., industrial feel, trash, graffiti, no greenery).",
    "Sidewalks may be present but are narrow, poorly maintained, or interrupted. Inconsistent or minimal pedestrian infrastructure (e.g., sidewalk gaps). Unsafe crossings or poorly lit areas. Roads are still wide with limited traffic-calming features. Sparse landscaping or aesthetic elements; few trees or visual appeal.",
    "Sidewalks are visible but may be narrow, uneven, or partially obstructed. Some pedestrian infrastructure, but with maintenance or connectivity issues. A few crosswalks, but crossing can still be difficult or intimidating. Moderately sized roads; some pedestrian protection like curb extensions or medians. Some greenery or pleasant features (trees, shopfronts), but not consistent.",
    "Wide, well-maintained sidewalks that allow comfortable walking. Clear, safe crosswalks with pedestrian-friendly traffic signals. Visible amenities like benches, trees, or small parks. Streets are narrower or include pedestrian buffers, making crossing safer. Clean and visually appealing environment, with consistent shade and landscaping.",
    "Wide, smooth, continuous sidewalks in excellent condition. Numerous, well-designed crosswalks and pedestrian-only areas. Abundant amenities like benches, parks, cafés, and shaded spots. Narrow or traffic-calmed streets that prioritize pedestrians over cars. Highly attractive surroundings: clean, landscaped, well-lit, and inviting.",

OLD PROMPTS FOR 3 LEVELS:

PROMPT 1 (HIGH WALKABILITY, this should be an above average street, not just "walkable" but a top of the line street):
- A highly walkable neighborhood with wide sidewalks, trees, and pedestrian paths.
- A highly walkable neighborhood and aesthetically pleasing neighborhood with trees, no trash, few cars, and wide sidewalks.
- A walkable street with wide sidewalks, frequent crosswalks, trees for shade, and little vehicle traffic. The environment is clean and visually pleasing.
A pedestrian-friendly neighborhood with landscaping, benches, and safe crossings. Streets are calm and shaded by trees.

PROMPT 2 (MEDIUM WALKABILITY, this is just an average street with not a lot of focus on aesthetics but there are still places to walk for pedestrians): 
- A somewhat walkable area with limited sidewalks and some vehicle traffic.
- A somewhat walkable neighborhood which is somewhat clean and has some sidewalks and some vehicle traffic.
- A neighborhood with some walkability features, such as occasional sidewalks and moderate vehicle traffic. Limited greenery and average maintenance.
Streets with patchy pedestrian infrastructure, some walkable areas, and modest visual appeal.

PROMPT 3 (LOW WALKABILITY, no pedestrian support, very dirty, lack of greenery, car-dominated):
- A car-focused neighborhood with no sidewalks and high-speed traffic.
- A dirty area filled with cars and trash which do not support pedestrian traffic, there are no sidewalks.
- A neighborhood lacking sidewalks or pedestrian crossings. Streets are dominated by fast-moving vehicles and offer no protection or amenities for pedestrians.
A car-oriented area with no pedestrian infrastructure, minimal greenery, and poor maintenance.
